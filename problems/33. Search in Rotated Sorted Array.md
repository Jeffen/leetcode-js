## Question[Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

**Example**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

## Explanation

Implement Binary Search algorithm while validate if rotation pivot is in the range bewteen `(left, mid)` or `(mid, right)`. If we know pivot is in lef-mid range, we judge if target is in mid-right, and move left/right cursor accordingly, vice versa.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var search = function(nums, target) {
    /** Solution 1: Beats 99.87% submissions however this is a O(N) method, the question need us
     * to resolve with O(logN), which means binary search.
     * return nums.indexOf(target)
     */

    // Solution 2: Binary search tree
    if (!nums || nums.length == 0) return -1;
    
    let left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.round(left + ((right - left)/2));
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] > nums[left]) {
            if (target >= nums[left] && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1
            }
        } else {
            if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1
            } else {
                right = mid - 1
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;

};
