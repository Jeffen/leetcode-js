## Question[Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

**Example:**
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

## Explanation

We assume that the string has 2n-1 posibble palindromic centers. We can go through each of the such center to see if it can compose a palindrome.

You might be asking why there are 2n - 12nâˆ’1 but not nn centers? The reason is the center of a palindrome can be in between two letters. Such palindromes have even number of letters (such as "abba") and its center are between the two 'b's.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
const longestPalindrome = function(s) {
    if (s.length <= 1) return s;

    let start = 0, end = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
      const len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
      const len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
      const len = Math.max(len1, len2);
      if (len > end - start) {
        start = i - (len-1) / 2;
        end = i + len / 2;
      }
    }
    return s.slice(Math.ceil(start), end + 1);
  };

  function expandAroundCenter(s, left, right) {
    let L = left, R = right;
    while (L > -1 && R < s.length) {
        if (s[L] !== s[R]) break;
        L--;
        R++;
    }
    return R - L - 1;
  }
