## Question[Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/

There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)

**Example**
```
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
```
Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

**Note:**
```
cells.length == 8
cells[i] is in {0, 1}
1 <= N <= 10^9
```
## Explanation

Cells will repeat every 14 days, however, please be noticed that 14th day's combination is different than 0 day's. The only way to get the answer is to estimate day by day.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} cells
 * @param {number} N
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var prisonAfterNDays = function(cells, N) {
    if (N === 0) return cells;
    
    const n = cells.length;
    const d = N%14 || 14;
    
    let curr = [...cells];
    for (let i = 0; i < d; i++) { 
      const newStates = [...curr];
      for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (j === 0 || j === n - 1) {
          newStates[j] = 0;
        } else {
          newStates[j] = curr[j-1] === curr[j+1] ? 1 : 0;
        }
      }
      curr = [...newStates];
    }
    return curr
};
```
