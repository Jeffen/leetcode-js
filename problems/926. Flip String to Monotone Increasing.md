https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-string-to-monotone-increasing/

A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly 0.)

We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or a '1' to a '0'.

Return the minimum number of flips to make S monotone increasing.

**Example**
```
Input: "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
```
```
Input: "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
```
```
Input: "00011000"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
```
Note:

1. 1 <= S.length <= 20000
2. S only consists of '0' and '1' characters.

## Explanation
### Approach 1
Skip 0's until we encounter the first 1.
Keep track of number of 1's in onesCount (Prefix).
Any 0 that comes after we encounter 1 can be a potential candidate for flip. Keep track of it in flipCount.
If flipCount exceeds oneCount - (Prefix 1's flipped to 0's)
a. Then we are trying to flip more 0's (suffix) than number of 1's (prefix) we have.
b. Its better to flip the 1's instead.

### Approach 2
An alternative DP solution with O(N) time and O(1) space is also possible.
The DP idea comes from concentrating on just the last bit. If the last bit is '1', then monotonicity is already guaranteed. But, if the last bit is '0', then there are two options: (1) either, the last bit can remain as it is, and all the remaining '1' bits to the left are flipped to '0', (2) or, the last bit is flipped to '1'.
