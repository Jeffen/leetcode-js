## Question[Medium]
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example**
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note**

Given n will always be valid.

## Explanation
First we will add an auxiliary "dummy" node, which points to the list head. The "dummy" node is used to simplify some corner cases such as a list with only one node, or removing the head of the list.

We could use two pointers. The first pointer advances the list by n+1n+1 steps from the beginning, while the second pointer starts from the beginning of the list. Now, both pointers are exactly separated by nn nodes apart. We maintain this constant gap by advancing both pointers together until the first pointer arrives past the last node. The second pointer will be pointing at the nnth node counting from the last. We relink the next pointer of the node referenced by the second pointer to point to the node's next next node.

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    const dummyNode = new ListNode('dummy');
    dummyNode.next = head;
    
    let cursor1 = 0, cursor2 = 0;
    let cursor1Node = dummyNode, cursor2Node = dummyNode;
    while (cursor1Node.next) {
        cursor1Node = cursor1Node.next;
        cursor1++;
        if (cursor1 - cursor2 === n+1) {
            cursor2Node = cursor2Node.next;
            cursor2++;
        }
    }
    cursor2Node.next = cursor2Node.next.next || null;
    return dummyNode.next;
};
