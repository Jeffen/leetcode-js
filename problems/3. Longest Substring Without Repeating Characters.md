https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example:**
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Explanation

This method is to use two cursors. First keep the left cursor fixed and move the right cursor, validate if the next char is in the substring between the two cursors. If so, move the left cursor to the new position and start over.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
const lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    const length = s.length;
    if (length <= 1) {
        return length;
    }
    let p = 0, q = 1, result = 1;
    while (q < length) {
        const sub = s.slice(p, q);
        const i = sub.indexOf(s[q]);
        if (i !== -1) {
            p = p + i + 1;
        }
        q++;
        result = Math.max(result, q - p);
        // console.log(`p:${p}, q: ${q}, sub: ${sub}, i: ${i}`)
    }
    return result;
};
```
